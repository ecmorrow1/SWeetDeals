# Note to teacher!
We may have to change our topic as South West may file a lawsuit and that would be terrible. 
I message you in slack and i hope we can possibly make up this deliverable later.

Background
* Building a web-scraping tool to collect data from the Southwest airlines 
website for trips that are taken frequently.  This is intended for providing a 
not-for-profit way of getting information from Southwest airlines for the 
purpose of optimizing the customer experience.
Motivation 
As a traveler who frequently flies the same itinerary to visit family, it will be nice to have a tool 
that can assist in finding the optimal times to schedule visits.
Questions to answer
* Which days are the best days for booking your flights with Southwest Airlines?
* How far in advance does someone have to buy tickets in order to get a good deal?
* Which day of the week is the best day to purchase tickets? (Southwest regularly holds 
sales on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but is that really the best time)
Tools/Modules to use
* Python
* Pandas
* Selenium
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* AWS
* Javascript
* D3
* leaflet
Data sets to use
* Data from the Southwest Airlines website
Tasks Breakdown
- Edward: Scraper to get the data (Python/Flask/Selenium)
- Brittanie: Data cleaning (Python)
- Deepankshi: Data storage (SQL/AWS)
- Waheed: Visualization (Javascript/D3/leaflet)
- Everyone (stretch goal): ML models to identify optimal buy times (sklearn)
